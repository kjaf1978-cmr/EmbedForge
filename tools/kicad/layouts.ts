// the board between a mains net and any other net. The control side is earthed (PE), so basic
// insulation suffices between it and the mains. Tracks 1.6 mm: 7 A at 20 K rise in 2 oz copper
// (IPC-2221 gives 1.45 mm; the stabiliser's highest current, 1 kVA at 140 V in)

// 230 V, which 1.5 mm in pollution degree 2 carries; IEC 62368-1 needs only that a short there
// is safe, and the breaker and fuse cover it); the 3.2 mm hold between the mains and every other
// net (the rule in board.kicad_dru for KiCad's check, a class-to-class rule for the router)
